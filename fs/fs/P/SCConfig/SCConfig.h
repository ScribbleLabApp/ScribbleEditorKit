/// **SCConfig** is a configuration model for managing ScribbleLab application settings.
///
/// This class encapsulates **metadata, sync settings, encryption, autosave, and document settings** 
/// for a userâ€™s file configurations. It provides properties for tracking document properties, 
/// enabling/disabling sync, configuring encryption, and defining autosave behavior.
///
/// Configurations can be loaded from XML files, edited at runtime, and saved back to disk.
///
/// @note **Availability:** macOS 15.0+ / iOS 18.0+
NS_AVAILABLE(15, 18)

/// This is typically set when the document is first created.

/// Updated whenever changes are made to the document.

/// The name or identifier of the document's author.
/// This is typically set when the document is first created.

/// Enables or disables synchronization of the document with a remote server.

/// The URL or identifier of the sync server.
/// This specifies where document changes are synchronized.

/// The frequency of automatic synchronization, measured in seconds.
/// This determines how often the document is synchronized with the server.

/// Example: 128, 256, 512.

/// Saves the configuration to a specified file path.

/// This method writes the current configuration to an external file,
/// ensuring that all settings are stored persistently.

/// @param filePath The file path where the configuration should be saved.
/// @discussion If the file path is invalid or inaccessible, the save operation will fail.
/// @note **Requires write permissions** to the specified directory.
